An implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search for combat in a Slay the Spire AI. Uses ForgottenArbiter's <a href="https://github.com/ForgottenArbiter/spirecomm">spirecomm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ForgottenArbiter/CommunicationMod">Communation Mod</a> packages. I use ForgottenArbiter's AI in his spirecomm package to do the non-combat tasks and use my AI for combat.
